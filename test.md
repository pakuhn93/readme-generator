## Tests
I've done so many console logs in this program. Feel free to check out the console if you're curious. I deleted the more spacious tests, such as making sure my strings are strings and so on. I used JSON at one point but then I realized that that was pointless when I can just deconstruct the object generated by the inquirer program.
