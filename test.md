# My Title
## Description
 This is a project that creates a professional README file
## Table of Contents
 There's only really one part of this program so you should be okay.
## Installation
 You're gonna have to do some command line work so I hope you like node!
## Usage
 Creates a professional README file based on user input.
## Contributors
 Me and all the stuff I've learned in coding bootcamp and have searched for on my own.
## License
 MIT because why not
## Tests
I've done so many console logs in this program. Feel free to check out the console if you're curious. I deleted the more spacious tests, such as making sure my strings are strings and so on. I used JSON at one point but then I realized that that was pointless when I can just deconstruct the object generated by the inquirer program.
